  abstract = "Single-cell technologies have transformed our understanding of
              human tissues. Yet, studies typically capture only a limited
              number of donors and disagree on cell type definitions.
              Integrating many single-cell datasets can address these
              limitations of individual studies and capture the variability
              present in the population. Here we present the integrated Human
              Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA), combining 49 datasets of the human
              respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.4 million
              cells from 486 individuals. The HLCA presents a consensus cell
              type re-annotation with matching marker genes, including
              annotations of rare and previously undescribed cell types.
              Leveraging the number and diversity of individuals in the HLCA, we
              identify gene modules that are associated with demographic
              covariates such as age, sex and body mass index, as well as gene
              modules changing expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of
              the bronchial tree. Mapping new data to the HLCA enables rapid
              data annotation and interpretation. Using the HLCA as a reference
              for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across
              multiple lung diseases, including SPP1+ profibrotic
              monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis and
              lung carcinoma. Overall, the HLCA serves as an example for the
              development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases
              within the Human Cell Atlas.",

  abstract = "Large single-cell atlases are now routinely generated to serve as
              references for analysis of smaller-scale studies. Yet learning
              from reference data is complicated by batch effects between
              datasets, limited availability of computational resources and
              sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep
              learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference
              called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses
              transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient,
              decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization
              of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data.
              Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and
              whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological
              state information while removing batch effects, despite using four
              orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration.
              scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing
              imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains
              coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping
              to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific
              cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by
              enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient
              use of reference atlases.",
